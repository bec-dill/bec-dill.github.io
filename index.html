               <p>Hi, My name is Rebecca Dillon and I currently work for BHP in the MECOE as a WMP for Blackwater Mine Prestrip. I have worked in mining for over 10 years in various production roles
            and have now moved over to see what the maintenance side of the business is all about. I also love to learn new things so have recently embarked on a challenging 6 month course with
            SheCodes to learn all about, you guessed it, coding! In my downtime I like to walk my dogs, read and powerlift. This is a very boring bio I know, but I intend to spice it up a little
            with my witty anecdotes and personal flair as my website comes together. Maybe. If I dont suffer a nervous breakdown first.
        </p>
