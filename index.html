               <p>Hi, My name is Rebecca Dillon and I currently work for BHP in the MECOE as a WMP for Blackwater Mine Prestrip. I have worked in mining for over 10 years in various production roles
            and have now moved over to see what the maintenance side of the business is all about. I also love to learn new things so have recently embarked on a challenging 6 month course with
            SheCodes to learn all about, you guessed it, coding! Various industries are now moving more and more towards automation and it seemed like an area that I would be interested in.
        </p>
            <p>In my downtime I like to walk my dogs, read and powerlift. I also won't say no to a tasty treat and one of my favourite things is fresh, hot, gluten-free, cinnamon donuts from the new farm
                markets. I love to grab a box of those and catch up with friends and family over a coffee.
        </p>
